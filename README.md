# sensors

I am aware this is already a feature of lm-sensors, I just thought it would be fun to code my own.

**Instructions for installation:**

ONLY TESTED ON POP OS, will probably work on other distributions although installing packages may be different
1) make sure lm-sensors is installed (`sudo apt-get install lm-sensors`, `sensors-detect`, hit enter to go with default options for everything)
2) download and extract the .zip
3) in the terminal cd to sensors-main
4) run `sudo chmod +x setup.sh`
5) run `./setup.sh`

**Use:**

from your home directory run `./sensors.sh`
